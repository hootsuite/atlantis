# Code Style

## Logging
- `ctx.Log` should be available in most methods. If not, pass it down.
- levels:
    - debug is for developers of atlantis
    - info is for users (expected that people run on info level)
    - warn is for something that might be a problem but we're not sure
    - error is for something that's definitely a problem
- **ALWAYS** logs should be all lowercase (when printed, the first letter of each line will be automatically capitalized)
- **ALWAYS** quote any string variables using %q in the fmt string, ex. `ctx.Log.Info("cleaning clone dir %q", dir)` => `Cleaning clone directory "/tmp/atlantis/lkysow/atlantis-terraform-test/3"`
- **NEVER** use colons "`:`" in a log since that's used to separate error descriptions and causes
  - if you need to have a break in your log, either use `-` or `,` ex. `failed to clean directory, continuing regardless`

## Errors
- **ALWAYS** use lowercase unless the word requires it
- **ALWAYS** use `errors.Wrap(err, "additional context...")"` instead of `fmt.Errorf("additional context: %s", err)`
because it is less likely to result in mistakes and gives us the ability to trace call stacks
- **NEVER** use the words "error occurred when...", or "failed to..." or "unable to...", etc. Instead, describe what was occurring at
time of the error, ex. "cloning repository", "creating AWS session". This will prevent errors from looking like
```
Error setting up workspace: failed to run git clone: could find git
```

and will instead look like
```
Error: setting up workspace: running git clone: no executable "git"
```
This is easier to read and more consistent

## Testing
- place tests under `{package under test}_test` to enforce testing the external interfaces
- if you need to test internally i.e. access non-exported stuff, call the file `{file under test}_internal_test.go`
- use our testing utility for easier-to-read assertions: `import . "github.com/hootsuite/atlantis/testing"` and then use `Assert()`, `Equals()` and `Ok()`
- don't try to describe the whole test by its function name. Instead use `t.Log` statements:
```go
// don't do this
func TestLockingWhenThereIsAnExistingLockForNewEnv(t *testing.T) {
    ...

// do this
func TestLockingExisting(t *testing.T) {
    	t.Log("if there is an existing lock, lock should...")
        ...
       	t.Log("...succeed if the new project has a different path") {
             // optionally wrap in a block so it's easier to read
       }
```
- each test should have a `t.Log` that describes what the current state is and what should happen (like a behavioural test)

# Glossary
* **Run**: Encompasses the two steps (plan and apply) for modifying infrastructure in a specific environment
* **Project Lock**: When a run has started but is not yet completed, the infrastructure and environment that's being modified is "locked" against
other runs being started for the same set of infrastructure and environment. We determine what infrastructure is being modified by combining the
repository name, the directory in the repository at which the terraform commands need to be run, and the environment that's being modified
* **Project Path**: The path relative to the repository's root at which terraform commands need to be executed for this Run
